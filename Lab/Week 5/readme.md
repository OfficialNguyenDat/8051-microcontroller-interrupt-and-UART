#### Problem 1: Read number A from keyboard ( 8 < A < 16 )
- Display on the screen "F" if A doesn't match the condition and read A again
- Define a binary string X in which the string length is defined by A and store it to BX register 
- Display the X in decimal form ( I struct in print value of 16bit to decimal - anyway I solve value of 8bit )

#### Problem 2: Read number A,B from keyboard 99 < A, B < 999 ( A is odd number )
- Display on the screen "F" if the number don't make the condition and read A, B again 
- Display the Max value ( A or B )
- Display the summation of digits from Max ( ex if max is 202 => 4 )

#### NOTED: We only use " mov add sub mul div je jl jle jg jge and or xor shl shr rol ror push pop " => To solve this problem.
